# Authentication and session handling
## NextAuth session vs. videodb session

A user must be authenticated to interact with most of the function of the NextJs pages. A user has to identify using their credentials
againts the VideoDbApi. If credentials are valid, api returns videodb session information (api token, refresh token). With this, user
is counted as "authenticated". This authentication state is handled by the NextAuth session.

Due to the scope of NextAuth, videob session informations are not persisted in this NextAuth session. Tough, this videodb session
informations are needed for any upcoming data request to the VideoDbApi in behalf of the authenticated user.
