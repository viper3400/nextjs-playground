# Authentication and session handling
## NextAuth session vs. videodb session

- A user must be authenticated to interact with most of the functions of the NextJs pages.
- A user has to identify using their credentials against the VideoDbApi. 
- If credentials are valid, the API returns videodb session information (api token, refresh token). 
- With this, user is "authenticated". 
- This authentication state is handled by the NextAuth session.
- Due to the scope of NextAuth, videob session informations are not persisted in this NextAuth session. 
- Tough, this videodb session informations are needed for any upcoming data request to the VideoDbApi in behalf of the authenticated user.


## Use Cases

- We need to support different use cases depending on the state of the NextAuthSession and the VidoeDbSession.
- For NextAuth there may be a session (NextAuthSession valid) or no session (NextAuthSession).
- For VideoDb the session state is described by a session token that can be valid or invalid.
  - When we have an invalid token, there is a refresh token for the session (which can be valid or invalid itself).
  - State of VideoDb session can just be retrieved by making a request.

This table show the combinations we have to cover:

<Table
  headers={['Use Case', 'NextAuthSession','Credentials', 'VideoDb Token', 'Refresh Token']}
  rows={[
    ['UC 1','invalid', 'valid', 'does not matter', 'does not matter'],
    ['UC 2','invalid', 'invalid', 'does not matter', 'does not matter'],
    ['UC 3','valid', 'does not matter', 'valid', 'does not matter'],
    ['UC 4', 'valid', 'does not matter', 'invalid', 'valid'],
    ['UC 5', 'valid', 'does not matter', 'invalid', 'invalid'],
  ]}
/>

### Use Case 1 (implemented)

In this use case we do not have a NextAuth session. So we have to authorize against VideoDb API again.
It does not play a role, if we probably would have a valid VideoDb session, as any request against the 
autorization API will serve a new token & refresh token.

This is the "normal" use case, as well, if a user is not logged in.

<Mermaid chart={`sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant NextJs
  participant NextAuth
  participant VideoDbAuthService
  participant PrismaDb
  participant VideoDbApi

  activate User
  User->>NextJs: request page
  activate NextJs
  NextJs ->> NextAuth: get NextAuthSession
  activate NextAuth
  NextAuth ->> NextJs: no session found
  deactivate NextAuth
  NextJs ->> User: Present login dialog
  deactivate NextJs
  User->>NextJs: provide valid credentials
  activate NextJs
  NextJs ->> NextAuth: handle auth request
  activate NextAuth
  NextAuth ->> VideoDbAuthService: authorize()
  activate VideoDbAuthService
  VideoDbAuthService ->> VideoDbApi: send auth request
  activate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbApi ->> VideoDbAuthService: provide videodb session information
  deactivate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbAuthService ->> PrismaDb: create or update session entry
  VideoDbAuthService ->> NextAuth: session
  deactivate VideoDbAuthService
  NextAuth ->> NextJs: provide NextAuth session infos
  deactivate NextAuth
  NextJs ->> User: provide authenticated access
  deactivate NextJs
  deactivate User
`} />

### Use Case 2 (partly implemented)

This is just a slight variation of the first use case. This time the user provides wrong credentials.
This use case is just partly covered. There is now just an error page in UI instead of stating that
credentials were wrong.

<Mermaid chart={`sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant NextJs
  participant NextAuth
  participant VideoDbAuthService
  participant PrismaDb
  participant VideoDbApi

  activate User
  User->>NextJs: request page
  activate NextJs
  NextJs ->> NextAuth: get NextAuthSession
  activate NextAuth
  NextAuth ->> NextJs: no session found
  deactivate NextAuth
  NextJs ->> User: Present login dialog
  deactivate NextJs
  User->>NextJs: provide invalid credentials
  activate NextJs
  NextJs ->> NextAuth: handle auth request
  activate NextAuth
  NextAuth ->> VideoDbAuthService: authorize()
  activate VideoDbAuthService
  VideoDbAuthService ->> VideoDbApi: send auth request
  activate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbApi ->> VideoDbAuthService: unauthorized
  deactivate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbAuthService ->> NextAuth: no session
  deactivate VideoDbAuthService
  NextAuth ->> NextJs: provide NextAuth session infos
  deactivate NextAuth
  NextJs ->> User: provide authentication error
  deactivate NextJs
  deactivate User
`} />

### Use Case 3 (demo implemented)

This use case assumes that a user is logged in and uses the VideoDbApi. This is considered the normal operation mode.

<Mermaid chart={`sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor User
  participant NextJs
  participant VideoDbService
  participant NextAuth
  participant PrismaDb
  participant VideoDbApi

  activate User
  User->>NextJs: request page
  activate NextJs
  NextJs ->> VideoDbService: request ()
  activate VideoDbService
  VideoDbService ->> NextAuth: get NextAuthSession
  activate NextAuth
  NextAuth ->> VideoDbService: session found / authorized
  deactivate NextAuth
 
  VideoDbService ->> PrismaDb: getSessionInfos()
  activate PrismaDb
  PrismaDb ->> VideoDbService: provideSessionInfos()
  deactivate PrismaDb
  VideoDbService ->> VideoDbApi: request()
  activate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbApi ->> VideoDbService: answerRequest()
  deactivate VideoDbApi
  VideoDbService ->> NextJs: result()
  deactivate VideoDbService
  NextJs ->> User: displayResult()
  deactivate NextJs
  deactivate User
`} />



#### What can go wrong?
**Invalid NextAuth session** 

What can go wrong here, is that sequence (3) may return no session in sequence (4). This is should immediatly
sign out the user from the session and this is assumed to be base functionality of NextAuth.js. The only way
we can imagine this even to happen, is that the browser stays open for a longer time with the page opened
without reload.

**No session information on PrismaDb**

Request in sequence (5) may not result in session information for the requested user session. Therefor system 
should sign out. But I did not get working this, yet.

**Error on API request**

This should be coverd in a separate topic. There a multiple things here, that may not went as well, as expected, 
between sequence (7) and (8).
